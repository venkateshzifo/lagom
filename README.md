# Lagom gRPC Example (Java)

## Guide

This example is described in the [Lagom gRPC Example (Java) guide](https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/lagom-java-grpc-example/)

This Hello World example illustrates using Akka gRPC as the communication mechanism between two Lagom services.  
Within 30 minutes, you should be able to download and run the example and use this guide to understand how the example is constructed.

This guide assumes basic knowledge about Akka-gRPC and Lagom but it also tries to make the amount of previous 
knowledge as small as possible. Feel free to refer to the 
[Akka-gRPC reference guide](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-grpc/current/) or the 
[Lagom documentation](https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/current/java/Home.html) for extra details.
